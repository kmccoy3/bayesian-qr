Bayesian quantile regression project completed for STAT 525 at Rice University. The final report is included as [report.pdf](./report.pdf). This report specifically discusses standard Bayesian quantile regression and longitudinal Bayesian quantile regression. We have also included code that implements the methods discussed in the report.
